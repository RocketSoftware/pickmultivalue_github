# Contributing to Pick MultiValue
Hello, World! And welcome to the Pick MultiValue GitHub community. Now that you're here, please review the [Code of Conduct](https://github.com/pickmultivalue/.github/blob/master/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md) that governs these projects and their contributors.

This community is unique in that the repositories contained herein are, for the most part, managed by the authors who have volunteered them to the community. Please be certain to abide by their specific rules and requirements. What follows is a guideline of general best practices for all. 

Often times in the MultiValue space, we end up working in small silos and reinventing wheels due to the lack of an open, accessible space for us to share solutions to problems. This community aims to solve for that by giving MultiValue users an open garden for the distribution of knowledge and utility. With that in mind, please be considerate of others! It is entirely possible that someone else may have submitted a solution similar to yours and while that should not prevent you from opening yours to the community, the intention should not be to dissuade users from leveraging "competing" utilities or invoking an argument of who-solved-it-best. We're all here to make the MultiValue world a better place, not fracture it further.
